    abstract = {2nd ed. Aircraft Engines and Gas Turbines is widely used as a text in the United States and abroad, and has also become a standard reference for professionals in the aircraft engine industry. Unique in treating the engine as a complete system at increasing levels of sophistication, it covers all types of modern aircraft engines, including turbojets, turbofans, and turboprops, and also discusses hypersonic propulsion systems of the future. Performance is described in terms of the fluid dynamic and thermodynamic limits on the behavior of the principal components: inlets, compressors, combustors, turbines, and nozzles. Environmental factors such as atmospheric pollution and noise are treated along with performance.This new edition has been substantially revised to include more complete and up-to-date coverage of compressors, turbines, and combustion systems, and to introduce current research directions. The discussion of high-bypass turbofans has been expanded in keeping with their great commercial importance. Propulsion for civil supersonic transports is taken up in the current context. The chapter on hypersonic air breathing engines has been expanded to reflect interest in the use of scramjets to power the National Aerospace Plane. The discussion of exhaust emissions and noise and associated regulatory structures have been updated and there are many corrections and clarifications.Jack L. Kerrebrock is Richard Cockburn Maclaurin Professor of Aeronautic's and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},
